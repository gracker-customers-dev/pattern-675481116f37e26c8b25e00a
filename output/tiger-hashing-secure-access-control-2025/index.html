                        <h2>Introduction to Tiger Hashing Algorithm</h2>

                            
                        <h3>Overview of Hashing Algorithms</h3>
<p>Hashing algorithms are fundamental cryptographic tools used to transform data into a fixed-size string of characters, which appears random. This process, known as hashing, enables the secure storage and processing of sensitive information, such as passwords. Hashing algorithms take input data and produce a unique hash value, ensuring that even the slightest change in the input results in a completely different output.</p>

                            
                        <h3>Significance of Tiger in Cryptography</h3>
<p>Tiger is a cryptographic hash function designed in the mid-1990s by Ross Anderson and Eli Biham. It is known for its speed and efficiency, making it particularly suitable for applications requiring high-performance hashing. The Tiger algorithm is significant in cryptography due to its resilience against various forms of attacks, including collision and pre-image attacks, ensuring the integrity and security of hashed data.</p>

                            
                        <h3>Comparison with Other Hashing Algorithms</h3>
<p>When comparing Tiger to other hashing algorithms like SHA-256 and MD5, Tiger stands out for its performance in hashing large data sets. While SHA-256 is widely recognized for its security, it is slower compared to Tiger. On the other hand, MD5 is more vulnerable to attacks, making Tiger a more reliable option for secure access control in modern applications.</p>

                            
                        <h2>Tiger Hashing Algorithm in Detail</h2>

                            
                        <h3>Technical Specifications of Tiger</h3>
<p>The Tiger hashing algorithm operates on 192-bit hash values, allowing it to produce secure, unique outputs for diverse input sizes. It employs a combination of three rounds of processing and utilizes a variable-length input, making it adaptable for various applications. The algorithm&#39;s structure is designed for efficiency, enabling it to perform well on both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures.</p>

                            
                        <h3>How Tiger Works: The Hashing Process</h3>
<p>Tiger processes input data in 512-bit blocks and employs a series of mathematical operations, including modular addition and bitwise operations. The algorithm&#39;s design consists of three distinct rounds, each contributing to the final hash value. This multi-round approach enhances security by making it difficult for attackers to reverse-engineer the original input from the hash.</p>

                            
                        <h3>Applications of Tiger in Security Systems</h3>
<p>Tiger&#39;s unique attributes make it ideal for a wide range of applications in security systems, including password hashing, data integrity verification, and digital signatures. Its speed allows for real-time processing, making it a preferred choice in environments where performance is crucial, such as online banking and e-commerce platforms.</p>
