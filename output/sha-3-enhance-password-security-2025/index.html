Given that passwords are often the first line of defense for accounts and sensitive data, implementing robust password security measures is vital to prevent identity theft and data breaches.</p>

                            
                        <h3>Common Threats to Password Security</h3>
<p>Common threats to password security include brute force attacks, phishing, and credential stuffing. Brute force attacks involve systematically trying every possible combination until the correct password is found. Phishing exploits human error, tricking users into revealing their passwords. Credential stuffing utilizes stolen credentials from one service to access accounts on another service, taking advantage of users who reuse passwords.</p>

                            
                        <h3>The Role of Hashing in Password Protection</h3>
<p>Hashing is a fundamental technique in password protection. When users create or update their passwords, hashing algorithms transform these passwords into hash values that are stored in databases. During the login process, the entered password is hashed again and compared to the stored hash. If they match, access is granted. This method ensures that even if a database is compromised, the actual passwords remain secure.</p>

                            
                        <h2>How SHA-3 Enhances Password Security</h2>
