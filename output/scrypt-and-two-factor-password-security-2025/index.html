By requiring additional verification beyond a password, MFA significantly enhances security, making it much harder for unauthorized users to gain access to accounts. In this new era of cybersecurity, understanding the tools available, including hashing algorithms like Scrypt and methods like two-factor authentication (2FA), is essential for everyone.</p>

                            
                        <h2>2. Understanding Scrypt as a Hashing Algorithm</h2>

                            
                        <h3>Definition and Purpose of Hashing Algorithms</h3>

                            
                        <p>Hashing algorithms are cryptographic functions that convert input data (like a password) into a fixed-size string of characters, which is typically a hash code. The primary purpose of hashing is to securely store passwords in a way that even if the data is compromised, the original password cannot be easily retrieved.</p>

                            
                        <h3>Key Features of Scrypt</h3>

                            
                        <p>Scrypt is a password-based key derivation function that was designed to be computationally intensive. It incorporates several unique features that set it apart in the realm of password hashing.</p>

                            
                        <h4>Memory-Hard Function</h4>

                            
                        <p>One of the standout features of Scrypt is its memory-hard function. This means that it requires a significant amount of memory to compute the hash, making it difficult for attackers to perform brute-force attacks using specialized hardware.</p>

                            
                        <h4>Resistance to GPU-Based Attacks</h4>

                            
                        <p>Scrypt&#39;s design also provides strong resistance against GPU-based attacks. Unlike traditional hashing algorithms, which can be optimized for speed using powerful graphics processors, Scrypt&#39;s memory requirements level the playing field, slowing down potential attackers significantly.</p>

                            
                        <h3>Comparison with Other Hashing Algorithms</h3>
