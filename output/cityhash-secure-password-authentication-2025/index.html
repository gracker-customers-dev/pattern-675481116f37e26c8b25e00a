                        <h3>Definition of Hash Functions</h3>
<p>A hash function is a mathematical algorithm that converts an input (or &#39;message&#39;) into a fixed-size string of bytes, typically a hash code. The output, known as the hash value, ideally should be unique to each unique input. Hash functions are widely utilized in various fields, including data integrity checks, digital signatures, and password storage.</p>

                            
                        <h3>Characteristics of Secure Hash Functions</h3>
<p>Secure hash functions exhibit several key characteristics: they are deterministic, meaning the same input will always produce the same output; they are quick to compute; they should be resistant to pre-image attacks (it should be difficult to reverse-engineer the original input from the hash); and they should also resist collision attacks (it should be hard to find two different inputs that produce the same output).</p>

                            
                        <h3>Role of Hash Functions in Data Integrity</h3>
<p>Hash functions ensure data integrity by allowing users to verify that the data has not been altered.
