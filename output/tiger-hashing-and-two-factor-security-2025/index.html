<p>Tiger hashing is widely utilized in password security systems due to its robustness and efficiency. Many developers integrate Tiger into their authentication systems to securely store user passwords. When a user creates a password, it is hashed using Tiger before being stored in the database. During authentication, the entered password is hashed again, and both hashes are compared, ensuring that the original password is never exposed.</p>

                            
                        <h2>Understanding Password Security</h2>
