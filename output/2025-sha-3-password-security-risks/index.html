                        <h3>1.1 Overview of SHA-3</h3>
<p>SHA-3, or Secure Hash Algorithm 3, is the latest member of the Secure Hash Algorithm family, designed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Introduced in 2015, SHA-3 utilizes a different cryptographic approach compared to its predecessors, SHA-1 and SHA-2. It is built on the Keccak algorithm, which offers robust security features and improved performance. As cybersecurity threats evolve, SHA-3 is becoming increasingly vital for securing sensitive information, particularly in the realm of password protection.</p>

                            
                        <h3>1.2 Importance of Hashing Algorithms in Password Security</h3>
<p>Hashing algorithms like SHA-3 play a crucial role in password security by converting plaintext passwords into fixed-length hash values. This transformation ensures that even if the hashed passwords are compromised, the original passwords remain protected. The effectiveness of a hashing algorithm directly influences the integrity of password storage systems, making it essential to choose a robust algorithm for safeguarding user credentials.</p>

                            
                        <h3>1.3 Evolution of SHA-3 in the Context of Cybersecurity</h3>
<p>Since its introduction, SHA-3 has evolved to address the changing landscape of cybersecurity threats. With increasing instances of data breaches and sophisticated attacks, the need for stronger hashing algorithms has never been more pressing. SHA-3 not only offers superior security features but also ensures compatibility with various applications, enhancing its relevance in modern cybersecurity practices.</p>
