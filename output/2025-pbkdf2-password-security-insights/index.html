Higher iteration counts increase security by making it more time-consuming for attackers to perform brute force attempts. In 2025, the recommended minimum iteration count has increased to ensure optimal protection against evolving threats.</p>

                            
                        <h3>Process of Hashing a Password</h3>
<p>The process of hashing a password using PBKDF2 involves several steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Generate a unique salt.</li>
<li>Combine the password and salt.</li>
<li>Apply the hashing function iteratively based on the specified iteration count.</li>
<li>Produce the final output, which is the derived key.</li>
</ol>

                            
                        <h3>Input Parameters</h3>
